# DCGAN Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) based on the paper **"Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks"** by Radford et al.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Uses the **CelebA** dataset for training.
- Dataset will be downloaded automatically.
